## Overview

This weekend I pushed through a personal cert sprint and came out the other side with **two certifications** and a **superbadge** completed. It was a focused effort to deepen both my development skills and my cross-cloud understanding — and I’m really happy with the outcome.

Specifically, I completed:

* The **Salesforce Marketing Cloud Administrator** certification
* The **Agentforce Specialist** certification
* The **Apex Specialist Superbadge**

These all tie directly into the kind of work I’ve been doing — and the kind I want to keep doing more of.

## Apex Specialist Superbadge

This one was the biggest lift of the three, and probably the most satisfying. The superbadge includes six separate coding challenges that simulate a real-world Salesforce service implementation. It covered everything from trigger logic and test coverage to governor limits, error handling, and reusable architecture.

### What I Learned

* **Bulk-safe Apex** is no longer just a concept — it’s a habit now
* **Test strategy** is more than getting to 75%; it’s about simulating real behavior and covering edge cases
* **Method reuse and exception handling** make the difference between passing and failing a challenge
* **Scheduling and asynchronous Apex** — using Queueable classes and understanding how to structure execution logic across transactions was a key part of building scalable code

### Debugging Tips

Some challenges took multiple attempts — not because the logic was broken, but because of little things like naming mismatches or overlooked data assumptions. I had to slow down, re-read everything, and test like I was in QA mode.

Walking away and coming back later definitely helped, too.

## Marketing Cloud Admin Certification

This was my first Marketing Cloud cert, and it gave me a better understanding of how subscriber keys, data extensions, user roles, and send classification logic all work together.

It’s a different model than core CRM, and getting this cert helped me appreciate how Marketing Cloud fits into the broader Salesforce ecosystem — especially for cross-cloud integrations and compliance-driven automation.

## Agentforce Specialist Certification

This one was more about domain knowledge than deep technical work, but it still mattered. Understanding how agent assignment, facility matching, and senior care workflows operate gave me better context for how Salesforce supports industry-specific implementations.

It also aligned well with some of the data modeling and automation work I’ve done before — and helped reinforce the importance of clean business logic on top of scalable configuration.

## Final Thoughts

I went into the weekend with a rough goal to make progress. I came out with three major wins that each added something different to my toolkit.

* **Apex Specialist** gave me deeper dev confidence
* **Marketing Cloud Admin** gave me more cross-cloud fluency
* **Agentforce Specialist** gave me business context and domain insight

Next up: I’ll be working on the **Advanced Apex Specialist Superbadge** and aiming to wrap up **Platform Developer II**. I’ll post more when I get there — but for now, just glad to have gotten this much done in a few focused days.
